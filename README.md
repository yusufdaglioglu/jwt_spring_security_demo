## User Passwords

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt is using to encode passwords.

## Database

- [http://localhost:8080/h2-console/](http://localhost:8080/h2-console/)
- This demo project use H2 db. If you want to change it, change the values of *application.yml*.
- For other databases like MySQL sequences don't work for ID generation. So you have to change the GenerationType in the
  entity beans to 'AUTO' or 'IDENTITY'.
